"""Task2"""

"""The Bell state (|00〉 + |11〉)/sqrt(2), which is a maximally entangled state, is created by initialising
a two qubit input state to |00〉 and applying a Hadamard gate to the first qubit and a CNOT gate with 
first qubit as control input and second qubit as target input. In this task, an error gate is added to
each of the two qubits before the CNOT gate. The error can be a bit-flip error (X gate), sign-flip 
error (Z gate) or an identity gate. Each of the two qubits are encoded using bit-flip or sign-flip code
and are subsequently measured in the Z-basis. On measuring the first qubit for the state (|00〉 + |11〉)/sqrt(2), 
the result of measuring the second qubit is guaranteed to yield the same value - '00' or '11'.

The first qubit state |0〉 is encoded using only sign-flip code because after applying Hadamard gate, a sign-flip error
would flip |+〉 to |-〉 but a bit-flip error would leave the state |+〉 unchanged. Similarly, the second qubit state |0〉 
is encoded using only bit-flip code because a sign-flip error would leave the state |0〉 unchanged. This eliminates the 
implementation of Shor Code to both of the input qubit states. Hence, the problem is simplified to encoding the 
first qubit state |+〉 as |+++〉 and the second qubit state |0〉 as |000〉. Now since the encoded states are only |+++〉 
and |000〉, the application of CNOTs during encoding for the sign-flip and bit-flip code is not required.
